# CARBON FOOTPRINT DETECTION AND REDUCTION WEBSITE

IMPRINT

Imprint is a website that tracks carbon footprints and reduces it. 

User inputs details such as list of food items, bike and car fuel consumption , electricity and water bill usage and computes the total carbon emissions that's produced. It then compares it against a recommended usage level of 5 metric tonnes. 

If its below 5 metric tones , it says that user is consuming everything in correct proportions and provides incentives in the form of coupon codes and vouchers. If its above , it says that user emits high amounts of carbon emission and suggests alternative ways to improve and lessen the consumption.
